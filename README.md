# Ticketify
A blockchain-powered app that issues non-transferrable NFT tickets for events (concerts, shows, etc.), purchased exclusively with cryptocurrency. Designed to eliminate black-market resales, each ticket’s ownership is permanently tied to the buyer’s wallet, with event details stored in tamper-proof metadata.
